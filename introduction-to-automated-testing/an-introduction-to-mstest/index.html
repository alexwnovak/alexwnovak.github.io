<p>So far in this series, we&rsquo;ve explored the concept of automated testing. We&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s nothing more than writing code to test other code. To mobilize this, we experimented with a custom console app that calls test functions that exercise the class we really wanted to test. We saw that this would show us when all the tests work&ndash;but also when they don&rsquo;t, to help us catch breaking changes. We don&rsquo;t yet have a sustainable way of doing this; maintaining a test-runner by hand isn&rsquo;t what we want, especially if we hope to accrue lots of tests.</p>

<p>We need a test framework.</p>

<h1 id="what-a-testing-framework-does">What a testing framework does</h1>

<p>Testing frameworks are super-common tools that we use to help organize and run our tests: They discover our test cases, they&rsquo;re able to run them, and they integrate really nicely with our development tools.</p>

<p>They take the place of our toy example of a console app. They provide the infrastructure for testing, so we can concentrate on higher-level concepts: the testing itself. We&rsquo;re freed up to put all our effort into writing clean code, and not the manual labor of bookkeeping.</p>

<h1 id="enter-mstest">Enter MSTest</h1>

<p>Testing frameworks exist for tons of languages, but we&rsquo;re interested in C#. The first test framework you&rsquo;ll encounter in this arena is <em>MSTest</em> from Microsoft. It comes with Visual Studio and is easy to use.</p>

<p>At its core, MSTest is made of <em>a DLL</em> and <em>a Visual Studio extension</em>. We&rsquo;ll see how each of these help us out. Over your time with automated testing in C#, you&rsquo;ll find other frameworks that may suit your needs better than MSTest. They all have their own features, but they&rsquo;re fundamentally made of these same two components.</p>

<h1 id="what-exactly-are-tests">What exactly are tests?</h1>

<p>Tests are methods, just like in our toy example. They live in <em>test classes</em>, and these are written specifically to jive with the test framework. For MSTest, it requires a few things. Let&rsquo;s take our <code>StringPluralizer</code> class from last time and see how we&rsquo;d write it for MSTest:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class StringPluralizerTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void PluralizesAStringWhenThereAreMultiple()
        {
            string result = StringPluralizer.Pluralize( &quot;thing&quot;, 2 );

            Assert.AreEqual( &quot;things&quot;, result );
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over the differences that make this work with MSTest.</p>

<h3 id="importing-the-mstest-namespace">Importing the MSTest namespace</h3>

<p>To write tests, we need to use a few attributes. We&rsquo;ll also use the <code>Assert</code> class to ensure our test results match what we expect. These guys live in the MSTest DLL that was mentioned earlier and they come from the <code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting</code> namespace. We&rsquo;ll use this stuff a lot, so we have a <code>using</code> directive to shorthand it.</p>

<h3 id="our-class-s-namespace">Our class&rsquo;s namespace</h3>

<p>Here, we wrote <code>namespace Tests</code>, but you can call it whatever you like. It should be meaningful for your project, typically named after the project you&rsquo;re testing, along with &ldquo;Tests&rdquo; at the end.</p>

<h3 id="the-class">The class</h3>

<p>The test class houses the test methods. It must be <code>public</code> and an <em>instance</em> class (as opposed to a static class). It also must have the <code>[TestClass]</code> attribute. The test runner looks for this combination of stuff, so if it isn&rsquo;t seeing your tests, double-check these things.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-method">The test method</h3>

<p>This is the test itself. It must be <code>public</code>, return <code>void</code>, and have the <code>[TestMethod]</code> attribute. The test runner looks for methods that match this criteria to be considered tests.</p>

<p>One test method should be one test case. That is, a single test should exercise only one scenario. When a test fails, it makes it really clear what the problem is. There&rsquo;s a lot of organization and strategy we can use to make robust tests that we&rsquo;ll explore in the future.</p>

<h3 id="the-method-body">The method body</h3>

<p>The first line was copied from last time. We use the object we want to test (sometimes called the &ldquo;system under test&rdquo;, or SUT), and capture its return value. Next, we use MSTest&rsquo;s <code>Assert</code> class to measure the result against the value we expect. For this test case, if everything works, then <code>&quot;things&quot;</code> is the right answer. The <code>Assert</code> class will fail the test if they don&rsquo;t match.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the <code>Assert.AreEqual</code> method will throw an exception if the values don&rsquo;t match. The test runner will report test failures if it sees unhandled exceptions. If no exceptions are thrown during the test, then it gives it a passing grade. <strong>This can be a &ldquo;gotcha.&rdquo;</strong> Make sure <em>all tests</em> assert something. Asserts are what make tests correctly pass and fail.</p>

<h3 id="what-else">What else?</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s the makeup of a test class. We spend the majority of our testing time writing test methods and enumerating cases. But we haven&rsquo;t yet seen where test classes live, or even how to run them. We&rsquo;ll wrap up by going through just that.</p>

<h1 id="where-tests-live">Where tests live</h1>

<p>With all this, we have a solid blueprint of what a test looks like. But where do we put these classes? The answer is a <em>test project</em>.</p>

<p>We keep tests in a different project than the application code. They&rsquo;re closely related, but their responsibilities are different. The test project needs to reference the MSTest DLL, but also the application project, since it has to see the classes it&rsquo;s testing. The test project acts on the application project, but not the other way around, so the app project shouldn&rsquo;t reference the test project. Objects shouldn&rsquo;t have to know how they&rsquo;re being used, so they remain generic and reusable. It doesn&rsquo;t help your app to know about tests, but instead just muddies the responsibilities.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a home for our tests.</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-test-project">Creating a test project</h1>

<p>Test projects are nothing more than class libraries with a reference to MSTest. You can create it manually this way, but it&rsquo;s much easier to use the project template. There are flavors of templates for different kinds of Windows development&ndash;regular .NET, .NET Core, UWP, etc. If you&rsquo;re doing a traditional console app, WinForms or WPF, you&rsquo;ll want the standard one:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Solution Explorer, right-click the solution itself and hit <em>Add</em> -&gt; <em>New Project</em></li>
<li>Find <em>Unit Test Project (.NET Framework)</em> (there&rsquo;s a search box if you need it)</li>
<li>Give it a name</li>
<li>Hit OK</li>
</ol>

<p>When naming your project, it&rsquo;s helpful to incorporate the name of the corresponding application project, so it&rsquo;s clear what it contains and what it&rsquo;s allowed to reference. For example, for the project <code>MyApplication</code>, the test project should be named something to the tune of <code>MyApplicationTests</code>. There are lots of conventions here, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter which you choose&ndash;go with one and be consistent. A few other examples are <code>MyApplication.Test</code>, <code>MyApplication.UnitTests</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>After creating the project, we&rsquo;re almost done. We need to reference the project we&rsquo;re going to test:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Solution Explorer, make sure the new test project is expanded</li>
<li>Right-click the <em>References</em> node</li>
<li>Hit <em>Add Reference&hellip;</em></li>
<li>Make sure <em>Projects</em> is selected, since we&rsquo;re referencing a project in the same solution</li>
<li>Check the box for the application project</li>
<li>Hit OK</li>
</ol>

<p>Your test project can now use all the <code>public</code> members from the application project. This means we can now start creating test classes, and writing tests, using the main project&rsquo;s objects.</p>

<h1 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h1>

<p>This varies depending on the test framework, but we&rsquo;re looking at MSTest today. Visual Studio has a few ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the <em>Test</em> menu, hit <em>Run</em> -&gt; <em>All Tests</em></li>
<li>From the Solution Explorer, right-click your project and hit <em>Run Unit Tests</em></li>
<li>Press the shortcut, which should default to <code>Ctrl+R</code>,<code>A</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;ll pop up the list of tests that it finds and give you a nice red/green status indicator for each one.</p>

<h1 id="what-now">What now?</h1>

<p>This is just the beginning. These basic steps are fundamental, and you&rsquo;ll need them again and again. Apps are often made of many projects, and that means we&rsquo;ll have lots of corresponding test projects, so you&rsquo;ll likely be making one before you know it.</p>

<h1 id="next-time">Next time</h1>

<p>With a baseline knowledge of what tests are and the basic structure of how they work, we&rsquo;re set to dig into the details a little more. Let&rsquo;s look past the foundational mechanics and into some philosophy. As we progress in anything, we&rsquo;re liable to find subtlety and nuance once we surpass the very basics&ndash;and there&rsquo;s no shortage of that in automated testing.</p>

<p>See you next time.</p>
